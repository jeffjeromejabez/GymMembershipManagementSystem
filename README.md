#Gym Membership Management System

Project Overview
A simple **Java console application** to manage gym members.  
Allows gym admins to **add, view, search, and cancel** memberships. Built using basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

---

 Problem Statement
Manual record-keeping (registers/spreadsheets) for gym members is slow and error-prone.  
This program provides a quick, menu-driven solution for small gym administration.

---

Target Users
- Gym Owners / Admins  
- Gym Staff  

---

- Add new member (ID, name, age, membership type)  
- View all members  
- Search member by ID  
- Cancel membership  

---

 OOP Concepts Used
- Encapsulation — Member class stores data.  
- Abstraction — Menu hides internal details; exposes simple operations.  
- Inheritance & Polymorphism** — Mentioned as future extensions (e.g., `PremiumMember`).
