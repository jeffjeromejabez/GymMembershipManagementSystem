# JAVA-PROJECT  
## GYM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  

The Gym Management System is a simple Java project that allows gyms/fitness centers to maintain and manage member information efficiently. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and modular design.

### Features  
- Add new members with unique ID, name, age, and membership type.  
-  View all registered members.  
-  Search for a specific member by ID or name.  
-  Cancel a memberâ€™s membership.  
-  Exit the system safely.  

---

### OOP Concepts Used  
- **Encapsulation:** Member details are stored in a `Member` class with controlled access.  
- **Abstraction:** The `GymManagementSystem` class hides implementation details and provides clear operations (add, view, search, cancel).  
- **Modular Design:** Program is divided into multiple classes (`Member`, `GymManagementSystem`, and `Main`) for readability and maintainability.
